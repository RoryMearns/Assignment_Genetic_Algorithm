# COSC343 Assignment: Genetic Algorithm

For this assignment we were tasked with implementing a genetic algorithm to optimise the fitness of a species of creatures over multiple generations in a simulated two-dimensional world. The world contains: food, poison, monsters (that eat the creatures) and the creatures themselves. The full assignment brief is contained in COSC343_Assignment_Brief.pdf

##Results & Report
I created my implementation using JavaScript using the HTML canvas element to graphically represent and animate my results in the browser. The full report of my results is contained in genetic_algorithm_report.pdf

##What Worked?
This was my first program built using JavaScript and it came out great. The creatures evolve as expected and the variables in the world are easily modified in the program. Plotting the results from multiple executions of the program (see report for graph) demonstrated the increasing performance of the creatures from generation to generation as is expected from a genetic algorithm. This project was fun. 

##What Didn’t Work? 
Some of my functions could have been implemented much better using recursion. I didn’t take advantage of JavaScript’s prototype inheritance which could have reduced the amount of code to some degree. Given more time I would also have liked to put a few buttons and form fields in the HTML document to be able to start/stop the animation and change a few variables from the browser.
